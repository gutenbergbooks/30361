<h1><span class="sp1">The Stowaway</span></h1>

<h2>By Alvin Heiner</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><i>He stole a ride to the Moon in search of
glory, but found a far different destiny.</i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His eyes</span> were a little feverish&mdash;as
they had been of late&mdash;and
his voice held a continuous
intensity&mdash;as though he were
imparting a secret. "I've got to get
on that ship! I've got to, I tell you!
And I'm going to make it!"</p>

<p>Different members of the group
regarded him variously, some with
amusement, some with contempt,
others with frank curiosity.</p>

<p>"You're plain nuts, Joe. What do
you want to go to the Moon for?"</p>

<p>"Sure, why you wanna go? What
they got on the Moon we ain't got
right here?"</p>

<p>There was general laughter from
the dozen or so who sat eating their
lunch in the shade of Building B.
They all thought that was a pretty
good one. Good enough to repeat.
"Sure, what they got on the Moon
we ain't got here?"</p>

<p>But Joe Spain wasn't in the
mood for jokes. He burned with
even greater conviction and stood
up as though to harangue the
workers. "You wanta know why I
got to go to the Moon? Why I've
got to get on that ship? Then I'll
tell you. It's 'cause I'm a little guy&mdash;that's
why! Joe Spain&mdash;working
stiff&mdash;one of the great inarticulate
masses."</p>

<p>More laughter. "Where'd you get
those big words, Joey? Out of a
book? Come on&mdash;talk English!"</p>

<p>Joe Spain pointed to the huge,
tubelike Building A, off across the
desert; the building you had to
have two different passes and a
written permit to enter. The mystery
building where even newspaper
reporters were barred. "It's
only the big shots they let in there
ain't it? Only them that's got a
drag or went to college or something.
Us little guys they tell go to
blow&mdash;ain't that right?"</p>

<p>"Who the hell cares? Maybe it's
a damn good place to stay away
from. Maybe it'll explode or something.
Who wants to die and collect
his insurance?"</p>

<p>"I got to get on that ship when it
blasts off because they can't push
the masses around! We got a right
to be represented even if we got to
sneak in!"</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;I'll stay on the ground."</p>

<p>"And besides there's the glory!
You guys are too stupid to see that
but it's there. The glory of being
on the first rocket ship to the
Moon. The name of Joe Spain
written down in the history books
and said over by people and school
kids for thousands of years! Immortality!
That's the word!"</p>

<p>"Well, just forget about it, Joe,
'cause you ain't going."</p>

<p>Joe Spain's eyes burned brighter.
"Joe Spain, coming down the ramp
with the big shots when it's all
over. News cameras snapping! People
asking for interviews!"</p>

<p>"But you ain't going 'cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joe shouted the man down. "And
another thing. Us little people are
entitled to a representative aboard
that ship. We got a right to know
what's going on. How come there's
nothing about it in the papers?
Only the big shots knowing about
it and whispering among themselves?
It's because they're trying
to snag it all and freeze us out!"</p>

<p>"You're crazy. It's for security
reasons. It's all hush-hush so it
won't leak out like the atom bomb
did. The big boys are being smart
this time."</p>

<p>"And you ain't getting on," the
interrupted man repeated doggedly,
"because there ain't a way in
God's world to <i>get</i> on. With triple
security all around the building,
just tell me a way to get in. Just
tell me one."</p>

<p>"I'm going to get on that ship,"
Joe Spain said. Then he clammed
up suddenly. Joe Spain wasn't
stupid. He was a talker, but he
knew when to stop sounding off.</p>

<p>The men went back to work
shifting the big aluminum barrels
from trucks into Building B. Carrying
the wooden crates and the paper-wrapped
parcels up the ramps
and to the side of the building facing the
big secret structure labeled A.
They worked until five o'clock.
Then they filed out and got into the
waiting trucks and were hauled
back to town; the boom town that
had mushroomed up in the desert
overnight and would die with the
same swiftness when the project
was completed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Joe went</span> straight to his rooming
house, washed up, put on his
good clothes, and found a stool in a
nearby restaurant. He ate a leisurely
supper, glancing now and again
at the clock. When the clock read
eight, he went out into the neon-stained
darkness and walked three
blocks to the Black Cat, one of the
three night clubs the desert town
boasted. He went to the bar and
ordered a drink. He downed it
slowly, carefully, after the manner
of a man who wanted to stay sober.</p>

<p>A half-hour passed before a thin,
nervous individual elbowed to
the bar and stood beside him. Joe
said. "Hello, Nick. You been thinking
it over?"</p>

<p>"I need a drink."</p>

<p>"Sure, Nick. Then we'll go some
place and talk." But Nick got rid of
five drinks while Joe protected his
own glass from the barkeep. After
a while, Joe said, "I'm willing to
up the price, Nick. Two thousand&mdash;cash.
All I got."</p>

<p>"Le's get out o' here," Nick
mumbled.</p>

<p>They walked out of the town and
into the desert, Nick stumbling now
and again, to be supported by the
tense, sober Joe. "Two thousand,
Nick. You need the dough."</p>

<p>"Sure. Need the dough. But it
wouldn't work. Couldn't get you
into one o' them barrels."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have to. All I ask
is that you come along in the morning
and seal me up in one. All you'll
have to do is lock on the lid."</p>

<p>"How you know the barrels are
going on the ship?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that. I just
know. I paid to find out."</p>

<p>"Okay&mdash;suppose you do get on
the ship in a barrel. Maybe it'll be
stored in a hold somewhere. Maybe
they wouldn't open it very soon.
You'd die."</p>

<p>"I got a way to get out. One of
them special torches. The little
ones. Aluminum isn't very strong.
I can cut it like butter."</p>

<p>"It'd be hot. You'd burn yourself."</p>

<p>"Let me worry about that," Joe
said fiercely. "You want the two
grand or not?"</p>

<p>Nick wanted the two thousand
and he was against the wall for excuses.
Then he had a happy
thought. "Barrels is air-tight. You'd
smother. Thing's im&mdash;impracac'l.
We'll forget it."</p>

<p>"I won't smother. I'm taking my
own oxygen. Enough to last me
clear to the Moon if it has to.
Come on. Break down!"</p>

<p>"Okay. For two grand. Got to
have the dough now though."</p>

<p>His heart singing, Joe Spain
counted out two thousand in cash.
When he'd finished he had exactly
nine dollars left. He was a pauper.
But the happiest pauper who ever
bought with his whole fortune the
thing he craved most.</p>

<p>"You won't double-cross me now,
will you? If you've got any ideas
like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll do like we said. Nick Sparks
never went back on his word&mdash;never.
But how you going to stay hid
when it's time to leave work?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to me. It'll be easy.
They don't check Building B too
close. No double check 'cause it's
over a mile from Building A&mdash;outside
the safety perimeter. I'll stay in
tomorrow night and I'll put a little
chalk-mark on the barrel I'm in&mdash;right
near the top rim. First
thing you do when you come to
work the next morning is seal it and
line it up with the filled ones."</p>

<p>"Okay, but I gotta go home now.
I got a head. I gotta get some
sleep."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"What's</span> in the duffel bag?"</p>

<p>"Clean overalls&mdash;towel."
Joe pulled the zipper down halfway.
The guard fingered the blue
denim but didn't dig deeper to find
the towel. He checked Joe's badge
number, made a note on his pad,
and motioned to the next worker.
Joe let tight breath slowly out of
his lungs as he walked toward
Building B. Getting past the guard
was a load off his mind. He'd expected
to get by, but it was one of
the calculated risks that could have
stopped him cold.</p>

<p>Once inside the building, he put
the bag into his locker and went to
work. He labored briskly and carried
more than his share of the
load. But now and again he stopped to
look over at the outline of Building
A, limned hard against hot blazing
sky. And each time it was with
a sense of heady exhilaration that
he thought of his destiny&mdash;his hard-earned,
dearly bought destiny. To
be among that select group who
would first set foot upon the surface
of the Moon!</p>

<p>He had no worries about not being
allowed to do so. Once he
showed himself&mdash;with the ship far
out in space&mdash;they'd have to accept
him. Not graciously of course, but
they'd have to admire his courage
and tenacity. They could not, in all
humanity, deny him a share of the
victory.</p>

<p>The day wore on and as quitting
time approached, he became more
tense&mdash;more alert. Five minutes before
the whistle, he faded back into
the building and hurried to the
lavatory. He went into the booth
furthest from the entrance and
locked the door. Now there was
nothing to do but wait. Another of
the calculated risks.</p>

<p>The whistle blew. Almost immediately,
the sound of footsteps
broke the silence and the lavatory
was filled with hurrying men. Their
stay in the room was short, however,
as Joe had known it would be.
Men leaving for home do not dawdle
on the premises.</p>

<p>The lavatory was empty again.
A period of silence while Joe raised
his feet from the floor and braced
them on the toilet seat. The entrance
door opened. A guard making
the departure checkup.</p>

<p>Joe held his breath. If the guard
came down the line and tried the
door, he was finished. But Joe had
banked upon human nature. The
guard stopped. For a long moment
there was no sound and Joe knew
the man was bending over to run
his eyes down the line of toilets
close to the floor. In this manner
he could see the floor of every
booth. The guard straightened,
turned, walked out. The door
closed. Silence. Joe's heart swelled
with gratitude. He grinned, looking
forward with joy to the long night
ahead.</p>

<p>He found a spot over behind the
barrels where the night watchman
would have to climb over a lot of
equipment in order to find him. He
made himself comfortable, practically
certain the guard would not
do this. He stretched out on the
hard floor and recorded the passing
of the hours by the number of times
the watchman went through.</p>

<p>And he was surprised at how
fast the time passed. Finally, checking
his count carefully, he left his
hiding place and tiptoed to the line
of lockers. He took the oxygen
equipment from the duffel bag after
which he hid the bag and the
clothing therein behind a wall
flange in a far corner. Then he
climbed into the barrel at the front
end of the packing line. He checked
the barrel with a small X, and
jockeyed the lid into place.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Time passed</span>. Nothing happened.
He wondered, if he'd
missed on the time element. The
men should certainly have come to
work now. More than once he was
tempted to push the barrel lid
aside and check the situation.
When footsteps sounded, close by,
and the lid snapped firmly into
place, he was glad he hadn't done
so. Good old Nick! When he got
back from the Moon, he'd see to it
that Nick got credit for his courageous
act.</p>

<p>Soon the barrel began to move.
Joe felt it rise into the air and settle
with a thump. Then the motor of a
truck roared and Joe knew where
he was going. Straight toward
Building A and the Moon rocket.
There was more movement until
finally the barrel was set down for
what appeared to be the last time.
Joe put the nose-piece of the oxygen
tube into place and visualized
himself safe and snug in a storage
room of the rocket.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and went
peacefully to sleep.</p>

<p>He slept a long time, to be awakened
by a crushing&mdash;a wrenching&mdash;that
all but drove his head down
into his spine. The pain brought
him sharply alert. He knew instantly
what had happened.</p>

<p><i>Blast-off.</i></p>

<p>He braced himself against the
sides of the barrel, and gritted his
teeth.</p>

<p>Soon it was better. Then no pressure
at all. Only the fierce happiness
on his heart. He'd set a course
and won through! He was on the
way to the Moon!</p>

<p>Joe let plenty of time elapse. He
knew it was well over an hour later
when he unlimbered the torch to
cut an escape-hole in the barrel.
This, he knew, would be tricky.
He could easily burn himself. The
heat would be intense.</p>

<p>But it wasn't too bad. The aluminum
cut quickly, and in a matter
of minutes he was standing beside
his barrel. As he'd suspected, it was
a storage hold. The pitch-darkness
did not bother him. He'd come prepared
with a small pencil flash
that threw an adequate beam.</p>

<p>He found the door, opened it
and went out into a long passageway....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now he'd</span> covered the length
and breadth of the ship. He'd
found a lot of rooms&mdash;all in pitch-darkness.
No observation ports.</p>

<p><i>And no living thing.</i></p>

<p>He stood frozen in one of the
rooms while the beam of his flash
picked out a code stenciled on a
steel plate over some piece of machinery.
X59-306MY&mdash;Experimental&mdash;Explosion
Rocket&mdash;Moon.</p>

<p>The flash dropped from Joe
Spain's fingers. He stood in the
pitch-darkness while the jets vibrated
through the rocket.</p>

<p>But there was no fear in him.
Only the great pain of futility. Only
his tears, and his whispered words:</p>

<p>"They'll never know. Nobody
won't ever know!"</p>
